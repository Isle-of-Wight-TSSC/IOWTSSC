<p>There are plenty of us younger Triumph owners, and it’s about time we all met in one place, at the same time, together. No excuses – this is going to be a cracking event with lots planned. The campsite has a bar, great facilities and will be full of Triumphs. Hard to beat that! The plan is: ‣ Saturday: Around 100 miles along the fantastic North Norfolk coast. ‣ Sunday: A short 30-mile morning run finishing in Great Yarmouth, from where people can head home if they wish.</p>
