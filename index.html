<p>The Isle of Wight TSSC Area was formed way back in 1988 when Paul and Jason first had the idea It has been going strong ever since! There are lots of the cars still around, some with their original owners, as well as some having been owned by more than one member. It has also brought new cars to the Island.</p>
<p>We are a friendly bunch - our meetings usually start with a drive out and alternate between a brunch run and an evening pub meet. All are welcome with friends or family, whether your car is on the road or not. Suggestions are always welcome.</p>
<p>Our other claim to fame is the Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend which has been going since 1990! The <a href="../weekend.html">Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend</a> is at the usual venue, <a href="https://www.waverleypark.co.uk/">Waverley Park Holiday Centre</a> in East Cowes. Occurring over the <a href="../iow.ics">first May Bank Holiday</a>, Friday 1<sup>st</sup> May to Monday 4<sup>th</sup> May 2026.</p>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:IOW@triumphsportsix.club?subject=newsletter">email</a> us to be added to our list so you can be kept up to date.</p>

<p>I'm Jo, the son of Elaine and Jason and have been around Triumphs all my life.<br>
I have "<em>driven</em>" Triumphs since I could sit on my parents lap and reach the steering wheel, but I first drove a Spitfire on the road in 2015.<br>

I'm Roxy and whilst I didn't grow up around Triumphs, they have been a key part of Jo and I's relationship. When he took me to my first IOW TSSC weekend in 2013, I absolutely loved it! Since then I have enjoyed every adventure we have had in our Spitfire, including our road trip to Le Mans classic in 2018.<br>
