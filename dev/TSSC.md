Unfortunately, there will be no meetings until lockdown is lifted.

PLEASE NOTE NEW DATES FOR OUR ISLE OF WIGHT TRIUMPH WEEKEND - FRIDAY 30 APRIL TO MONDAY 3 MAY 2021

We are a friendly bunch - our meetings usually start with a drive out and alternate between a brunch run and an evening pub meet, all welcome with friends or family whether your car is on the road or not, so please put the following dates in your diary and look out for more details each month.

For those who might miss having a monthly brunch run then Pinky and Martin have offered to take up the mantel so we will be keeping you informed of extra meeting dates as well as any summer pizza runs we might add in, so there will be plenty of chance to get out in your classics. Please share any of your own plans if you would like us to join you.

Happy Motoring!
