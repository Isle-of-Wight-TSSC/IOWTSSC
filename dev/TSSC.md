# TSSC


We are a friendly bunch - our meetings usually start with a drive out and alternate between a brunch run and an evening pub meet, all welcome with friends or family whether your car is on the road or not, so please contact us for dates and details for our plans for the month.  Please share any of your own plans if you would like us to join you.

Happy Motoring!
Jo and Roxy
