The [Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend](/weekend.html) will be held over the [first May Bank Holiday](/iow.ics), Friday 1^st^ May to Monday 4^th^ May 2026.

## Featured Events

### [North Norfolk Coastal Run](https://youth.triumphsportsix.club)

There are plenty of us younger Triumph owners, and it’s about time we all met in one place, at the same time, together. No excuses – this is going to be a cracking event with lots planned. The campsite has a bar, great facilities and will be full of Triumphs. Hard to beat that! The plan is: ‣ Saturday: Around 100 miles along the fantastic North Norfolk coast. ‣ Sunday: A short 30-mile morning run finishing in Great Yarmouth, from where people can head home if they wish.
