## Christmas Meal

On Friday 20th December at 7:30pm we are having our Christmas meal at [The Wight Mouse](https://www.wightmouse.co.uk/)
This should be a lovely evening with maybe even a festive game or two thrown in.
If you would like to join us, please let us know with your [meal choices](assets/xmas24meal.jpg) by the end of November as weâ€™ll need to let the pub know.
