# Jason and Elaine

Jason and I both joined the TSSC in 1987 when we both owned Spitfires. We met at the very first Isle of Wight Camping Weekend back in 1990 and now have two teenagers together. My spitfire is in need of restoration so is currently in storage. Jason however has managed to own most of the six triumphs originally associated with the Club and is now back to owning a Spitfire.

The Isle of Wight car club weekend has gone from strength to strength and is attended by orginal members who attend year on year as well as new members who are always welcome.

Angela with the help of Graham and IWTSSC members has organised the weekend for over a decade now and wishes to have a break from being the organiser so Tracy Cleaver and myself have taken on the mantle for 2015!
