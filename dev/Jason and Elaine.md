# Jason and Elaine

Jason and I joined the TSSC in 1987 when we both owned Spitfires. We met at the very first Isle of Wight Camping Weekend back in 1990 and now have two grown up children together, Jo and Ellen.  Jason has managed to own most of the six Triumphs originally associated with the Club.  Jason's last Spitfire has now been handed on to Jo and Roxy as their wedding present.

The Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend has gone from strength to strength and is attended by original members who attend year on year as well as new members who are always welcome.
