The Isle of Wight TSSC Area was formed way back in 1988 when Paul and Jason first had the idea, it has been going strong ever since. Lots of the cars are still around on the island and many have been owned by more than one member.

We are a friendly bunch - our meetings usually start with a drive out and alternate between a brunch run and an evening pub meet, all welcome with friends or family whether your car is on the road or not, Suggestions are always welcome.

Our other claim to fame is the camping weekend which has been going for 35 years this year! The [35th Isle of Wight camping weekend](/weekend.html) is at the usual venue, Waverly Holiday Park over the first May bank holiday, 3rd to 6th May, 2024.

Please [email](mailto:IOW@triumphsportsix.club?subject=newsletter) us to be added to our list so you can be kept up to date.
