# TSSC Isle Of Wight Area
![menubar](/dev/menubar.md)



The Isle of Wight TSSC Area was formed way back in 1988 when Paul and Jason first had the idea, it has been going strong ever since. There are lots of the cars still around some with their original owners as well as some having been owned by more than one member and new cars arriving on the Island. 

We are a friendly bunch - our meetings usually start with a drive out and alternate between a brunch run and an evening pub meet, all welcome with friends or family whether your car is on the road or not, Suggestions are always welcome.

Our other claim to fame is the Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend which has been going since 1990! The [35th Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend](/weekend.html) is at the usual venue, [Waverley Park Holiday Centre](https://www.waverleypark.co.uk/) in East Cowes, over the first May Bank Holiday, Friday 3rd May to Monday 6th May, 2024.

Please [email](mailto:IOW@triumphsportsix.club?subject=newsletter) us to be added to our list so you can be kept up to date.
