# TSSC Isle Of Wight Area

![menubar](/dev/menubar.md)

The Isle of Wight TSSC Area was formed way back in 1988 when Paul and Jason first had the idea It has been going strong ever since! There are lots of the cars still around, some with their original owners, as well as some having been owned by more than one member. It has also brought new cars to the Island.

We are a friendly bunch - our meetings usually start with a drive out and alternate between a brunch run and an evening pub meet. All are welcome with friends or family, whether your car is on the road or not. Suggestions are always welcome.

Our other claim to fame is the Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend which has been going since 1990! The [Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend](/weekend.html) is at the usual venue, [Waverley Park Holiday Centre](https://www.waverleypark.co.uk/) in East Cowes. Occurring over the first May Bank Holiday, Friday 3^rd^ May to Monday 6^th^ May 2024.

Please [email](mailto:IOW@triumphsportsix.club?subject=newsletter) us to be added to our list so you can be kept up to date.
