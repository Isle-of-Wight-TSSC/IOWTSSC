The Isle of Wight TSSC Area was formed way back in 1988 when Paul and Jason first had the idea, it has been going strong ever since. 

There are lots of the cars still around some with their original owners as well as some having been owned by more than one member and new cars arriving on the Island. We get together on an casual basis but try to meet up monthly for either a brunch run or an evening social in a local pub, venue suggestions are always welcome. 

Our other claim to fame is the Isle of Wight Triumph Weekend which has been going since 1990, it is organised for the first Bank Holiday in May each year and is currently held at the Waverley Park Holiday Centre in East Cowes.
