# Jo & Roxy

I'm Jo the son of Elaine and Jason and have been around Triumphs all my life. ![Jo sat on a spitfire](/assets/jovgt.jpeg "Jo sat on a spitfire")
I have "*driven*" Triumphs since I could sit on my parents lap and reach the steering wheel but I first drove a spitfire on the road in 2015. ![my first time driving a spitfire](/assets/1stdrive.JPG "my first time driving a spitfire")
Earlier this year you would have seen me on the cover of the courier ![Jo and Roxy in their spitfire on there wedding day](/assets/courier.jpeg "Jo and Roxy in their spitfire on there wedding day") for my wife and I's wedding.

We had a busy 2023 but are looking forward to continuing the mantle of the isle of wight triumph sport six club area.
