The sun has been shining on The Island (or at least trying to) for the last few months, so we have gone out for a couple of lovely brunch runs. In February a group of us met up at Brading Downs for a convoy and delicious breakfast at Chessell Pottery Cafe. Then in March we met up at Blackgang Viewpoint for a convoy towards a very yummy garlicy breakfast at The Garlic Farm. We even introduced our new puppy Luna to our Spitfire and she loved being in it! As the weather is picking up, it is so lovely to be out and catch up as a group!

This is our last report before our Triumph Weekend, so for those of you that are coming, we cannot wait to see you!

Happy Motoring
