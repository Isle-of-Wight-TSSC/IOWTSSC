We had a lovely run out for drive it day, but the star of the show since the last courier for us, was the Isle of Wight Triumph weekend! First of all a big thank you to all who attended, we are overwhelmed with the support and positivity we received from our first event as AOs. We all had a great time and loved the convoys (even if a few people did end up off piste). We had a really nice time catching up with the other areas and are hoping to make it over to see some of you later in the year! Car of the show went to (stag OYF 1R), congratulations Jason! Quackers is settling in nicely to his home with Andy and family! And a massive congratulations to The Devon Dumpings for sweeping the floor on games night! 
Thanks again everyone!
