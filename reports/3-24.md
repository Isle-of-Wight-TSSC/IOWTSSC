Hi all 

Further to the news of Elaine standing down as AO for the Isle of Wight area. We are honoured to have been voted in to carry on the good work that Elaine and Tracy have achieved over the past 10 years.

Here comes an introduction to us both...

I'm Jo, the son of Elaine (previous Co-AO) and Jason (Isle of Wight TSSC Area co-founder) and have been around Triumphs all my life.

I have "*driven*" Triumphs since I could sit on my parents lap and reach the steering wheel, but I first drove a Spitfire on the road in 2015.

I'm Roxy and whilst I didn't grow up around Triumphs, they have been a key part of Jo and I's relationship. When he took me to my first IOW TSSC weekend in 2013, I absolutely loved it! Since then I have enjoyed every adventure we have had in our Spitfire, including our road trip to Le Mans classic in 2018.

Last year you would have seen us on the cover of The Courier for our wedding.

We have had a busy 2023 but are looking forward to continuing the mantle of the Isle of Wight Triumph Sport Six Club area including the Isle of Wight Camping Weekend.
