It’s been a busy summer on the Island and we’ve been trying to make the most of what nice weather we’ve had.

In August a group of us headed down to Freshwater bay for stone based pizzas[iow1] with a sea view which was lovely.

In September 14 of us met at Carisbrooke for a drive out through the countryside, stopping for breakfast at The Donkey Sanctuary in Wroxall. [iow2 iow3]It was a beautiful day and really nice to catch up over a coffee and some cake.

As the Island quietens down we’re looking forward to having more time to get out and about!
